## Motivation or Problems
  * There are multiple standards of module system in JS world including CommonJS, AMD, ES6 modules and `<script>` tag style.
  * There are two extremes when transferring modules
    1. one request per module
    2. All modules in one request
  * Why should a module system only help the developer with JavaScript?

## IO
Webpack is a module bundler.

It takes a bunch of files, treating each as a module, figuring out the dependencies between them, and bundle them into static assets that are ready for deployment.

### Some concepts of Webpack
* chunk: A batch of modules that bundled into one single file.

* loader: Transformations that are applied on a resource file(module) of your app.

* plugin: Add functionality typically related to bundles in webpack.

### Some plugins
  * DefinePlugin: Allows you to create global constants which can be configured at compile time.

  * HotModuleReplacementPlugin: Enables Hot Module Replacement.

  * HtmlWebpackPlugin: Generates a solid base html page for your web application with all your webpack generated css and js files built in.

  * CommonsChunkPlugin: Generate an extra chunk, which contains common modules shared between entry points.

  * UglifyJsPlugin: Minimize all JavaScript output of chunks.

  * ExtractTextPlugin: Extract text from bundle into a file.

### Example of Webpack configuration

*notice comments start with hash character*

```
{
  ...
  module: {
    ...
    loaders: [
      # They are functions that take the source of a resource file as the parameter
      # and return the new source.
      { test: /\.less$/,
        loader: 'css-loader!less-loader' },
      { test: /\.js$/,
        loader: 'babel',
        include: '/path-to-your-project/vue-webpack',
        exclude: /node_modules/ },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```
